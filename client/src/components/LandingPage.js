    <p className="p-5">Welcome to Traveled + True!</p>
    <p>This application was designed by <a className="profile-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannah-papa/">Hannah Papa</a> at Nashville Software School </p>
    <p className="p-5">Traveled + True is designed for the true crime enthusiast on the go. While we're often familiar with cases that are local, we may be unaware of those in our vicinity as we travel. This app will allow the user to dive into crimes based on travel destinations. Visiting New York? Simply select your destination and the app will present you with fascinating stories centered around that location. Users can then access various media sources to digest differing viewpoints, and are presented with ways to get involved whether it be keeping an eye out, spreading the word, or signing a petition. Traveled + True is here to make you more aware on your journeys and more engaged with the communities you visit.</p>
