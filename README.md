<h1>Welcome to Traveled + True!</h1>

An app for the true crime enthusiast on the go

**Created using C#, SQL, and Reactstrap**

<H2>Overview</H2>
While we're often familiar with cases that are local, we may be unaware of those in our vicinity as we travel. Traveled + True will allow the user to dive into crimes based on travel destinations. Simply select your destination to create a journey and the app will present you with fascinating stories centered around that location. Users can then access various media sources to digest differing viewpoints, and are presented with ways to get involved whether it be keeping an eye out, spreading the word, or signing a petition. Traveled + True is here to make you more aware on your journeys and more engaged with the communities you visit.

Connect those interested in true crime with the locations they visit  <br/>

<!-- <H2>Lessons Learned</H2>
This project was created as my final capstone for Nashville Software School. The objective was to build a single page web application using technologies learned thus far. 

<br/> 
I wanted to be able to track plant growth and care in a user-friendly app. Once I had created the initial structure, I began using the app repeatedly. In doing so, I saw opportunities for added features. This inspired me to enable the user to add more plant types, as well as fertilizer types. 

<br/>
Just as the plants are always growing, so are my skills as I learn to build a better application, to improve my understanding, and to hone in on the user experience. I'm proud of what I've created, but am eager to improve along this journey.
